# Module4


## Description

The motivation with this project was to set up a quiz for answer questioning and keeping track of score. With much help was able to get a code going with this work,
however still believe it requites more work to it. Hoping this wills suffice.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
